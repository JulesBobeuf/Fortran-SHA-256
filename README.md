# Fortran SHA-256

This is a simple SHA-256 implementation in Fortran.

## IMPORTANT 

Please do not use this in your professional projects. There will eventually be a release whenever the algorithm will be verified.

## TO DO

- Support 448+ bit passwords
- Retrieve the password you want to encode from the command line directly (or any better way)
- Improve the code

## My configuration

- Windows 11
- gfortran and mingw32-make

## How to launch the app

- make (or mingw32-make)
- ./SHA-256.exe

### Notes

This is my very first time programming in Fortran. The code will be improved in the future, whenever I will feel more comfortable with the language.
